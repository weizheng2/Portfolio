								SUMMARY
Type: Professional Experience
Platforms: Android/iOS
Links: Google Play, iOS
Role:FullStack Programmer
Studio: Dark Curry (Barcelona, Spain)
Time: November 2021 - Present

Fight Legends, also known as Dark Steel, is the project I was assigned to after finishing my internship with the Studio and becoming a full time programmer.
Implemented game mechanics, features, plugins, etc.

Main notable contributions:

-General:
Ensure any feature or update can be added without disrupting the previous versions. Allowing the coexistence of multiples versions from the same store or different stores.
Implemented different A/B testing processes, where the game showed different features or with some variations to test which one performed better.

-Addressables:
Implemented asynchronous asset loading using Unity Addressables System and a custom Google Play Addressables Plugin, overcoming build size restrictions and enhancing performance.
Previously used Amazon Web Services for storing the assets.

-Referral:
Referral system that allows players to invite others and earn rewards.

-Event:
Created the first event in the game. It has a system where players can enter undefeated enemy rooms and continue where the other players left.
Since multiple players can try to enter the room, I had to make sure to only let the first request in, avoiding any race condition.
Additionally, it contains a complete new enemy model and a special shop where players can flip cards to get random rewards.

-IAPs, subscription and bundles
For each store, I had to validate the receipts received in the server after a player buys any IAP. 
Also, schedule calls to update subscription data and process refunded, canceled or not given IAPs.

-Tournaments and rankings:
Made a ranking system where players would obtain point from playing a specific game mode. It rewarded special icons for the chat.
Players can see the rankings changing in real time, current and last weeks positions and a global ranking.

-Tutorial:
Designed and implemented a comprehensive tutorial system, guiding players through core game mechanics, combat actions and main interface screens.

Made a complete tutorial that guides players through core game mechanics and combat strategies. It has a continous flow at the start of the game and then it appears again after unlocking new content.
The system has an announcer with text lines and images, a screen blocker that only allows clicks on the desired buttons and each part can be decoupled, allowing the player to leave and continue after connecting again.

-Back system
A 'back' system that allows the user to close pop ups, return to the previous screen, pause the game, etc.

-Builds
I was in charge of making the builds for all the different stores, ensuring the compliance.
Also integrated payment platform Xsolla, to facilitate transactions across different regions and app stores.

-Chat system (mods, block, ban etc)
Created a chat system where players can either comunicate in global channels or send private messages.
Players can also block/unblock others and if enabled to be a moderator, they have the ability to ban other players.

-Local and push notifications
Enabled Local Notifications with Unity Mobile Notifications for scheduled events.
Push notifications with Firebase for various instant actions. 
Also made an internal notifications interface for when the player is currently in game and with the screen focused.

-Ads and other plugins
Added advertisement plugins to show rewarded videos and interstitials. The probability to show is controlled via server.

-Village mode
A village mode, where players can collect and upgrade buildings that provide different boosts for their account. 

-Multiples characters
Developed a multi-character system, enabling players to create, switch, and manage multiple characters.
Since the game was designed for one character per user, I had to make plenty of changes and make sure those changes did not affect the production game/server.
