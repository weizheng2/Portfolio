								SUMMARY
Type: Professional Experience
Platforms: Android/iOS
Links: Google Play, iOS
Role:FullStack Programmer
Studio: Dark Curry (Barcelona, Spain)
Time: November 2021 - Present

Fight Legends, also known as Dark Steel, is the project I was assigned to after finishing my internship with the Studio and becoming a full time programmer.
Implementent game mechanics, features, plugins, build and submit, etc.

Main notable contributions:

-Addressables:
Following Google Play build size restriction, we had to find a way to load the assets separately. We tried loading the assets from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and then from our own server but each had their problems.
At the end we ended up using the Unity Addressables System and a Google Play Addressables Plugin.
This was the initial major change I had to make, and had to use asynchronous loadings (UniTask) for the first time which caused a lot of problems. However, this taught me a lot about asynchronous operations.

-Referral:
Referral system that allows players to invite others and earn rewards. This feature greatly increased the number of new players.

-Event:
Made the first event in the game. Implemented a system where players could enter a same room, and had to make sure all request where ordered and didnt had any race condition or that entered at the same time
 new models, keep the combat state since, the first mode where multiples players could try to enter, so we had to add a error or filters
Crypta Tesoro -> ok

-Iap, subscription and bundles ok


-Tournaments and rankings:
Tournaments that different rankings 

-Tutorial:
Made a complete tutorial that shows the user all the basic features. It has a continous flow at the start and then it appears again after unlocking new content.
The system has an announcer with text lines and images, a screen blocker that only allows clicks on the desired buttons and each part can be decoupled allowing to leave and continue after connecting again.
Also made a combat tutorial

all the flow, arrows, announcer, block everything, ensure nothing breaks, and the combat tutorial, combat tutorial UI - ok 

-Back system signals

-Builds for different stores, each their own IAP validation
Xsolla, for purchased

-Chat system (mods, block, ban etc) ok 

-Local and push notifications - 
-Ads and other plugins 

-Village mode ok

-Multiple character ok
